# üß† SQL Joins Practice ‚Äî Airbnb Clone Dataset

This repository contains SQL queries written to demonstrate mastery of various SQL JOIN types using a simplified Airbnb-style database. The project explores how to effectively retrieve relational data using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and simulated `FULL OUTER JOIN` in MySQL.

## üéØ Objective

To master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins.

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Overview

The project uses the following relational tables:

- `user` ‚Äî Contains user details such as first name, email, and role.
- `property` ‚Äî Lists properties hosted on the platform.
- `booking` ‚Äî Contains booking data, linked to both users and properties.
- `review` ‚Äî Stores user reviews for properties.
- `payment` ‚Äî Tracks payment information for bookings.
- `message` ‚Äî Includes messages exchanged between users.

## üìå Queries Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN: Retrieve All Bookings and the Users Who Made Them

```sql
SELECT
    booking.booking_id,
    booking.property_id,
    booking.start_date,
    booking.end_date,
    booking.total_price,
    booking.status,
    user.user_id,
    user.first_name,
    user.last_name,
    user.email
FROM booking
INNER JOIN user ON booking.user_id = user.user_id;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN: Retrieve All Properties and Their Reviews (If Any)

```sql
SELECT 
    property.host_id,
    property.name,
    property.location,
    property.pricepernight,
    review.review_id,
    review.property_id,
    review.rating,
    review.comment
FROM property
LEFT JOIN review ON property.property_id = review.property_id
ORDER BY review.rating ASC;
```

‚úÖ This query includes all properties, even if no review exists for them.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN (Simulated in MySQL): Retrieve All Users and All Bookings

```sql
SELECT
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status
FROM user u
LEFT JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id

UNION

SELECT
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    b.booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status
FROM user u
RIGHT JOIN booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id;
```

‚úÖ Since MySQL does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` natively, this approach uses a `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

## üõ† Tools Used
- **MySQL** for data storage and querying.
- **SQLTools Extension (VS Code)** for writing and running SQL queries locally.

## üìö Learning Outcomes
- Understood differences between `INNER`, `LEFT`, and simulated `FULL OUTER JOIN`s.
- Practiced writing complex queries that extract meaningful insights from relational data.
- Learned to simulate `FULL OUTER JOIN` in MySQL using `UNION`.
